BARBARIANS ARE MIGHTY WARRIORS WHO 
are powered by primal forces of the multi-
verse that manifest as a Rage. More than a 
mere emotion- and not limited to anger-this Rage 
is an incarnation of a predator's ferocity, a storm's 
fury, and a sea's turmoil. 
  Some Barbarians personify their Rage as a fierce 
spirit or revered forebear. Others see it as a con-
nection to the pain and anguish of the world, as an 
impersonal tangle of wild magic, or as an expression 
of their own deepest self. For every Barbarian, their 
Rage is a power that fuels not just battle prowess, 
but also uncanny reflexes and heightened senses. 
Barbarians often serve as protectors and leaders 
in their communities. They charge headlong into 
danger so those under their protection don't have 
to. Their courage in the face of danger makes Bar-
barians perfectly suited for adventure.

bard_info = """
INVOKING MAGIC THROUGH MUSIC, DANCE, 
and verse, Bards are expert at inspiring others, 
soothing hurts, disheartening foes, and creat
ing illusions. Bards believe the multiverse was spo-
ken into existence and that remnants of its Words 
of Creation still resound and glimmer on every 
plane of existence. Bardic magic attempts to harness 
those words, which transcend any language. 
Anything can inspire a new song or tale, so Bards 
are fascinated by almost everything. They become 
masters of many things, including performing mu-
sic, working magic, and making jests. 
A Bard's life is spent traveling, gathering lore, tell
ing stories, and living on the gratitude of audiences, 
much like any other entertainer. But Bards' depth of 
knowledge and mastery of magic sets them apart.

cleric_info = """
CLERICS DRAW POWER FROM THE REALMS
of the gods and harness it to work miracles. 
Blessed by a deity, a pantheon, or another 
immortal entity, a Cleric can reach out to the divine 
magic of the Outer Planes-where gods dwell-and 
channel it to bolster people and battle foes. 
Because their power is a divine gift, Clerics typ-
ically associate themselves with temples dedicated 
to the deity or other immortal force that unlocked 
their magic. Harnessing divine magic doesn't rely 
on specific training, yet Clerics might learn prayers 
and rites that help them draw on power from the 
Outer Planes. 
Not every member of a temple or shrine is a 
Cleric. Some priests are called to a simple life of 
temple service, carrying out their devotion through 
prayer and rituals, not through magic. Many mor-
tals claim to speak for the gods, but few can marshal 
the power of those gods the way a Cleric can. 
"""

druid_info = """
DRUIDS BELONG TO ANCIENT ORDERS THAT 
call on the forces of nature. Harnessing 
the magic of animals, plants, and the four 
elements, Druids heal, transform into animals, and 
wield elemental destruction. 
Revering nature above all, individual Druids gain 
their magic from nature, a nature deity, or both, 
and they typically unite with other Druids to per-
form rites that mark the passage of the seasons and 
other natural cycles. 
Druids are concerned with the delicate ecological 
balance that sustains plant and animal life and with 
the need for people to live in harmony with nature. 
Druids often guard sacred sites or watch over re-
gions of unspoiled nature, but when a significant 
danger arises, Druids take a more active role as ad-
venturers who combat the threat. 
"""

fighter_info = """
FIGHTERS RULE MANY BATTLEFIELDS. 
Questing knights, royal champions, elite sol-
diers, and hardened mercenaries-as Fighters, 
they all share an unparalleled prowess with weap-
ons and armor. And they are well acquainted with 
death, both meting it out and defying it. 
Fighters master various weapon techniques, and 
a well-equipped Fighter always has the right tool at 
hand for any combat situation. Likewise, a Fighter is 
adept with every form of armor. Beyond that basic 
degree of familiarity, each Fighter specializes in cer-
tain styles of combat. Some concentrate on archery, 
some on fighting with two weapons at once, and 
some on augmenting their martial skills with magic. 
This combination of broad ability and extensive spe-
cialization makes Fighters superior combatants.
"""

monk_info = """
MONKS USE RIGOROUS COMBAT TRAINING
and mental discipline to align themselves
with the multiverse and focus their inter-
nal reservoirs of power. Different Monks conceptu-
alize this power in various ways: as breath, energy, 
life force, essence, or self, for example. Whether 
channeled as a striking display of martial prowess 
or as a subtler manifestation of defense and speed, 
this power infuses all that a Monk does. 
Monks focus their internal power to create ex-
traordinary, even supernatural, effects. They chan-
nel uncanny speed and strength into their attacks, 
with or without the use of weapons. In a Monk's 
hands, even the most basic weapons can become so-
phisticated implements of combat mastery. 
Many Monks find that a structured life of ascetic 
withdrawal helps them cultivate the physical and 
mental focus they need to harness their power. 
Other Monks believe that immersing themselves in 
the vibrant confusion of life helps to fuel their de-
termination and discipline. 
Monks generally view adventures as tests of their 
physical and mental development. They are driven 
by a desire to accomplish a greater mission than 
merely slaying monsters and plundering treasure; 
they strive to turn themselves into living weapons.
"""

paladin_info = """
PALADINS ARE UNITED BY THEIR OATHS TO
stand against the forces of annihilation and 
corruption. Whether sworn before a god's 
altar, in a sacred glade before nature spirits, or in a 
moment of desperation and grief with the dead as 
the only witnesses, a Paladin's oath is a powerful 
bond. It is a source of power that turns a devout 
warrior into a blessed champion. 
Paladins train to learn the skills of combat, mas-
tering a variety of weapons and armor. Even so, 
their martial skills are secondary to the magical 
power they wield: power to heal the injured, smite 
their foes, and protect the helpless and those who 
fight at their side. 
Almost by definition, the life of a Paladin is an 
adventuring life, for every Paladin lives on the front 
lines of the cosmic struggle against annihilation. 
Fighters are rare enough among the ranks of a 
world's armies, but even fewer people can claim the 
calling of a Paladin. When they do receive the call, 
these blessed folk turn from their former occupa-
tions and take up arms and magic.

FAR FROM BUSTLING CITIES, AMID THE 
trees of trackless forests and across wide 
plains, Rangers keep their unending watch in 
the wilderness. Rangers learn to track their quarry 
as a predator does, moving stealthily through the 
wilds and hiding themselves in brush and rubble. 
Thanks to their connection with nature, Rangers 
can also cast spells that harness primal powers of 
the wilderness. A Ranger's talents and magic are

the ravages of monsters and tyrants. 
"""

rogue_info = """
ROGUES RELY ON CUNNING, STEALTH, AND 
their foes' vulnerabilities to get the upper 
hand in any situation. They have a knack for 
finding the solution to just about any problem. A 
few even learn magical tricks to supplement their 
other abilities. Many Rogues focus on stealth and 
deception, while others refine skills that help them 
in a dungeon environment, such as climbing, finding 
and disarming traps, and opening locks. 
In combat, Rogues prioritize subtle strikes over 
brute strength. They would rather make one precise 
strike than wear an opponent down with a barrage 
of blows. 
Some Rogues began their careers as criminals, 
while others used their cunning to fight crime. 
Whatever a Rogue's relation to the law, no common 
criminal or officer of the law can match the subtle 
brilliance of the greatest Rogues. 
"""

sorcerer_info = """
SORCERERS WIELD INNATE MAGIC THAT IS 
stamped into their being. Some Sorcerers can't 
name the origin of their power, while others 
trace it to strange events in their personal or family 
history. The blessing of a dragon or a dryad at a 
baby's birth or the strike of lightning from a clear 
sky might spark a Sorcerer's gift. So too might the 
gift of a deity, exposure to the strange magic of 
another plane of existence, or a glimpse into the 
inner workings of reality. Whatever the origin, 
the result is an indelible mark on the Sorcerer, a 
churning magic that can be passed down through 
generations. 
Sorcerers don't learn magic; the raw, roiling 
power of magic is part of them. The essential art of 
a Sorcerer is learning to harness and channel that 
innate magic, allowing the Sorcerer to discover new 
and staggering ways to unleash their power. As Sor-
cerers master their innate magic, they grow more 
attuned to its origin, developing distinct powers 
that reflect its source. 
Sorcerers are rare. Some family lines produce 
exactly one Sorcerer in every generation, but most 
of the time, the talents of sorcery appear as a fluke. 
People who have this magical power soon discover 
that it doesn't like to stay quiet. A Sorcerer's magic 
wants to be wielded.

warlock_info = """
WARLOCKS QUEST FOR KNOWLEDGE 
that lies hidden in the fabric of the mul-

magical power by delving into tomes of forbidden 
lore, dabbling in invocations meant to attract the 
power of extra planar beings, or seeking places of 
power where the influence of these beings can be 
felt. In no time, each Warlock is drawn into a bind-
ing pact with a powerful patron. Drawing on the 
ancient knowledge of beings such as angels, archfey, 
demons, devils, hags, and alien entities of the Far 
Realm, Warlocks piece together arcane secrets to 
bolster their own power. 
Warlocks view their patrons as resources, as 
means to the end of achieving magical power. Some 
Warlocks respect, revere, or even love their patrons; 
some serve their patrons grudgingly; and some seek 
to undermine their patrons even as they wield the 
power their patrons have given them. 
Once a pact is made, a Warlock's thirst for knowl-
edge and power can't be slaked with mere study. 
Most Warlocks spend their days pursuing greater 
power and deeper knowledge, which typically 
means some kind of adventure. 
"""

wizard_info = """
WIZARDS ARE DEFINED BY THEIR 
exhaustive study of magic's inner work-
ings. They cast spells of explosive fire, 
arcing lightning, subtle deception, and spectacular 
transformations. Their magic conjures monsters 
from other planes of existence, glimpses the future, 
or forms protective barriers. Their mightiest spells 
change one substance into another, call meteors 
from the sky, or open portals to other worlds. 
Most Wizards share a scholarly approach to 
magic. They examine the theoretical underpinnings 
of magic, particularly the categorization of spells 
into schools of magic. Renowned Wizards such as 
Bigby, Tasha, Mordenkainen, and Yolande have built 
on their studies to invent iconic spells now used 
across the multiverse. 
The closest a Wizard is likely to come to an or-
dinary life is working as a sage or lecturer. Other 
Wizards sell their services as advisers, serve in mili-
tary forces, or pursue lives of crime or domination. 
But the lure of knowledge calls even the most 
unadventurous Wizards from the safety of their 
libraries and laboratories and into crumbling ru- 
ins and lost cities. Most Wizards believe that their 
counterparts in ancient civilizations knew secrets 
of magic that have been lost to the ages, and discov-
ering those secrets could unlock the path to a power 
greater than any magic available in the present age.

to bring light, healing, and heavenly fury. 
Aasimar can arise among any population of 
mortals. They resemble their parents, but they live 
for up to 160 years and have features that hint at 
their celestial heritage, such as metallic freckles, 
luminous eyes, a halo, or the skin color of an angel 
(silver, opalescent green, or coppery red). These 
features start subtle and become obvious when the 
aasimar learns to reveal their full celestial nature.

The ancestors of dragonborn hatched from the 
eggs of chromatic and metallic dragons. One story

Another story claims that dragons created the first 
dragonborn without the gods' blessings. Whatever 
their origin, dragonborn have made homes for 
themselves on the Material Plane. 
Dragonborn look like wingless, bipedal dragons--
scaly, bright-eyed, and thick-boned with horns on 
their heads--and their coloration and other features 
are reminiscent of their draconic ancestors. 
"""

dwarf_info = """
Dwarves were raised from the earth in the elder 
days by a deity of the forge. Called by various 
names on different worlds- Moradin, Reorx, and 
others-that god gave dwarves an affinity for stone 
and metal and for living underground. The god also 
made them resilient like the mountains, with a life 
span of about 350 years. 
Squat and often bearded, the original dwarves 
carved cities and strongholds into mountainsides 
and under the earth. Their oldest legends tell of 
conflicts with the monsters of mountaintops and 
the Underdark, whether those monsters were tow-
ering giants or subterranean horrors. Inspired by 
those tales, dwarves of any culture often sing of val-
orous deeds-especially of the little overcoming the 
mighty. 
On some worlds in the multiverse, the first settle-
ments of dwarves were built in hills or mountains, 
and the families who trace their ancestry to those 
settlements call themselves hill dwarves or moun-
tain dwarves, respectively. The Greyhawk and 
Dragonlance settings have such communities.
"""

elf_info = """
Created by the god Corellon, the first elves could 
change their forms at will. They lost this ability 
when Corellon cursed them for plotting with the 
deity Leith, who tried and failed to usurp Corellon's 
dominion. When Leith was cast into the Abyss, 
most elves renounced her and earned Corellon's for-
giveness, but that which Corellon had taken from 
them was lost forever. 
No longer able to shape-shift at will, the elves 
retreated to the Feywild, where their sorrow was 
deepened by that plane's influence. Over time, cu-
riosity led many of them to explore other planes of 
existence, including worlds in the Material Plane. 
Elves have pointed ears and lack facial and body 
hair. They live for around 750 years, and they don't 
sleep but instead enter a trance when they need to 
rest. In that state, they remain aware of their sur-
roundings while immersing themselves in memories 
and meditations. 
An environment subtly transforms elves aA:er 
they inhabit it for a millennium or more, and it 
grants them certain kinds of magic. Drow, high 
elves, and wood elves are examples of elves who 
have been transformed thus.
"""

gnome_info = """
Gnomes are magical folk created by gods of inven-
tion, illusions, and life underground. The earliest 
gnomes were seldom seen by other folk due to the 
gnomes' secretive nature and their propensity for 
living in forests and burrows. What they lacked 
in size, they made up for in cleverness. They con-
founded predators with traps and labyrinthine 
tunnels. They also learned magic from gods like 
Gari Glittergold, Baervan Wildwanderer, and Bar-
avar Cloakshadow, who visited them in disguise. 
That magic eventually created the lineages of forest 
gnomes and rock gnomes. 
Gnomes are petite folk with big eyes and pointed 
ears, who live around 425 years. Many gnomes like 
the feeling of a roof over their head, even if that 
"roof" is nothing more than a hat.

aths' gigantic kin. 
Goliaths have physical characteristics that are 
reminiscent of the giants in their family lines. For 
example, some goliaths look like stone giants, while 
others resemble fire giants. Whatever giants they

the multiverse-unencumbered by the internecine 
conflicts that have ravaged giantkind for ages-and 
seek heights above those reached by their ancestors.

halfling_info = """
Cherished and guided by gods who value life, home, 
and hearth, halflings gravitate toward bucolic ha-
vens where family and community help shape their 
lives. That said, many halflings possess a brave and 
adventurous spirit that leads them on journeys of 
discovery, affording them the chance to explore a 
bigger world and make new friends along the way. 
Their size- similar to that of a human child-helps 
them pass through crowds unnoticed and slip 
through tight spaces. 
Anyone who has spent time around halflings, par-
ticularly ha I fling adventurers, has likely witnessed 
the storied "luck of the halflings" in action. When a 
halfling is in mortal danger, an unseen force seems 
to intervene on the halfling's behalf. Many halflings 
believe in the power of luck, and they attribute their 
unusual gift to one or more of their benevolent 
gods, including Yondalla, Brandobaris, and Charma-
laine. The same gift might contribute to their robust 
life spans (about 150 years). 
Halfling communities come in all varieties. For ev-
ery sequestered shire tucked away in an unspoiled 
part of the world, there's a crime syndicate like the 
Boromar Clan in the Eberron setting or a territorial 
mob of halflings like those in the Dark Sun setting.
