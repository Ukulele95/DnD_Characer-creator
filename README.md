# DnD_Characer-creator
This is my first project, so I know it could be a lot better. I'm using it to learn. I would apretiate, if you don't just improve my code, but instead give me helpful tipps, on how I can improve it. I want to write all the code myself if possible, to become better and learn as much as possible.

The idea behind this project, is to have a DnD-Character creator, who works without further explanation. Even a first time player could use it, and have a fully playable character in the end.
